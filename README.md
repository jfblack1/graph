# graph
This is a graph module. It contains a graph class which allows for the representation of graphs consisting of
nodes and associated edges and node weights. The class contains methods for finding the number of nodes in a
graph, finding the shortest path between two nodes, finding all the nodes which may be reached from a node 
within a graph, finding all possible groups within a graph, adding a node, and balancing a graph. There is also 
a method for creating random graphs.
